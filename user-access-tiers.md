## Defined Tiers for User Access Based on Verification Status

Creating well-defined tiers for user access in your dating app is essential for enhancing safety, engagement, and overall user experience. Below, I’ll provide a clearer, more in-depth description of each tier, including access levels, features, and the rationale behind them.

---

Tier 1: Unverified Users

- Description: Users who have registered on the platform but have not yet completed the verification process.

Access Level:

- Limited Profile Creation: Users can create a profile with basic information (name, age, interests).
- Basic Messaging: Ability to send messages only to verified users; no multimedia sharing (photos, videos).
- Visibility: Profiles are less prominent in search results and matchmaking algorithms.

Features:

- Profile Browsing: Can browse profiles but with restrictions (e.g., cannot see full profiles of verified users).
- Limited Interaction: Can “like” or “favorite” profiles but cannot initiate conversations.
- Rationale: This tier helps maintain a degree of safety by limiting interactions between unverified users. It encourages them to complete the verification process to unlock more features.

Tier 2: Verified Users

- Description: Users who have successfully completed the verification process, confirming their identity.

Access Level:

- Full Profile Access: Users can complete their profiles with additional information and photos.
- Unlimited Messaging: Can send and receive messages to/from all users, including other verified users.
- Search Visibility: Higher visibility in search results and matching algorithms.

Features:

- Multimedia Sharing: Ability to send and receive photos and videos in messages.
- Profile Badges: Display a verification badge on their profile, enhancing credibility.
- Access to Basic Filters: Can use filters to find matches based on interests, location, and other preferences.
- Rationale: This tier provides users with the assurance that they are interacting with others who have verified their identities, promoting a safer and more engaging experience.

Tier 3: Premium Verified Users

- Description: Users who have completed the verification process and subscribed to a premium membership, offering additional benefits.

Access Level:

- All Features of Tier 2: Full access to all features available to verified users.
- Enhanced Visibility: Premium profiles may receive priority placement in search results and matchmaking suggestions.

Features:

- Profile Boosts: Ability to boost their profile visibility for a limited time to increase matches.

- Exclusive Events: Invitations to virtual or in-person events, mixers, or community gatherings for premium users.

## Additional Considerations for Each Tier

- User Education: Clearly communicate the benefits of each tier during the onboarding process and through in-app notifications. This helps users understand the value of moving to a higher tier.
- Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback system where users can share their experiences and suggest improvements for each tier. This helps refine features and addresses user needs.
- Incentives for Upgrading: Consider offering limited-time promotions or discounts for users to upgrade to premium status after verification.
- Periodic Re-Verification: To maintain trust, consider requiring periodic re-verification for premium users, especially if they are highly active on the platform.

By clearly defining these tiers, you can create a structured approach that encourages user engagement, enhances safety, and fosters a positive community within your dating app.
